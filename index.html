          <h3>The web has a problem :(</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            I have to start us off on kind of a dour note, by pointing out that
            the web has a problem. It's not a new problem – it's actually
            been around since the beginning of the web, but it's an interesting problem,
            and it's going to motivate the rest of my talk.

            <video height=680 src="vid/kirby_1.webm" loop data-autoplay></video>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            This problem is pretty easy to reproduce. All you need to do is
            make a web page with an animated gif - just a simple web page!

            Then fire up your dev console and enter some long-running JavaScript
            operation, like this loop. What you'll notice is that the GIF is
            blocked for the entirety of the loop.

            You can reproduce this in all the browser, by the way: Chrome, Firefox,
            Safari, and IE.

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            But it doesn't just affect animated GIFs - it affects almost everything
            on your page that moves. HTML5 video, JavaScript animations, CSS animations
            (except for hardware-accelerated ones) will all be stopped.

            In fact, it's worse than that - any form elements on the page will be
            non-interactive as well. Note that I can't click on any checkboxes or
            buttons while this is running.

          <h3>Every line of frontend JS you've ever written has (momentarily) stopped your page from working.</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            Of course, the reason for this is that JavaScript is single-threaded,
            and the browser environment (i.e. the DOM) is single-threaded. So while
            JavaScript is running, the browser can't do anything else.

            That's kind of a mind-blowing thought, right? It means that every line of JavaScript you've ever written has (momentarily) stopped your page from working. (Frontend JavaScript, anyway.)

            We should feel humbled by this fact. We have this great responsibility with the JavaScript we use.

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            Now, you might not have ever written *such* a long-running JavaScript operation
            that you blocked the page entirely. But have you ever made or seen a page that looked like this?

            It's functional, but it feels kinda... off. I can interact with the page, but occasionally
            the scrolling locks up, and the animations might briefly jerk for a few split-seconds. It works, but
            it doesn't feel *good*.

            Now, this isn't due to one big long-running operation - this is due to lots of little operations
            that add up over time. It's death by a thousand cuts.

            Why does this happen? Well, we can explain with MATH!

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            Most monitors will refresh at 60 frames per second. What that means is that,
            every second, they flash an image 60 times, which gives the illusion of movement. It's just
            like this flipbook.

            If you do the math, and divide 1000 milliseconds by 60 frames, you get 16.7 milliseconds.
            What that means is that, any JavaScript you do has to complete in under 16.7 milliseconds if
            you want to stay at 60 FPS.

          <aside class="notes">
            If you factor in browser overhead, according to Paul Lewis on the Chrome team, this is actually
            even smaller. 10ms for all your JavaScript to execute! That's tiny! that's punishingly small!

            And if you think it's bad on desktop, try mobile, where we have slower CPUs.

            to write this post about how Android phones just aren't fast enough to run Discourse, which is
            an Ember app. Newer iPhones are barely fast enough, but Android phones just aren't there.

            This is the kind of stuff that leads people to say, "Well, I guess the web's not ready for rich,
            immersive 60fps mobile apps. We'll have to write an iOS or Android app instead!" But I take exception
            with that, because I _am_ an Android developer, and I know the tricks that native developers use to
            milk performance out of a weak CPU.

            I'm not going to go too deep into this code, but a web worker is basically a background thread that you can spawn
            whenever you want to do a bit of JavaScript work. Anything that runs inside the worker runs on another thread (another
            process in fact), so it cannot possibly block the DOM.

          <aside class="notes">
            See, the way that UIs work, on both the web, Android, and iOS, is that you have one thread, called the main
            thread, whose responsibility is to respond to UI events like clicks and scrolling, and to paint.

            This UI thread is pretty busy. You'd be busy too, if somebody asked you to paint something every 16 milliseconds!
            Plus, we're sending down our giant 500KB JavaScript app, which we also expect him to run within those 16 milliseconds.

            So what'd be nice, is if the UI thread could spawn some friends to help him out. Then those friends
            could work independently, and he wouldn't be trying to do so much himself.

            This is great, because we can actually spawn as many workers as we want, and even low-end Android phones sold
            today have 4 cores. So potentially we can do many things at once, in addition to the UI.

            When we want to do something that's unrelated to UI - business logic, reading from local storage, talking to the
            network, we shove that off in a background thread.

            So what can you do inside of a web worker? Well, you have ajax and IndexedDB, and like I said,
            those actually *can* block the DOM, so it's worthwhile to put them in a web worker. You can also
            do any normal JS operations, except for the DOM. But hey, you can do Virtual DOM, right?

          <aside class="notes">
            So I experimented with this, and I demonstrated that it's possible. I wrote an app
            with an architecture where every UI event basically gets fired off as an action to the web worker.
            Inside the web worker, it generates the Virtual DOM tree, diffs it with the previous tree, and then
            sends the patch (i.e. the minimal set of operations to be applied to the DOM) back to the main thread.

            This is great that the patch tends to be small, because the *only* cost you pay with a web worker on the main
            thread is the cost of serializing and de-serializing the messages sent back and forth with the worker.

            This think this stuff is going to start popping up in frameworks. It's already going to appear in Angular 2, which is
            where I got the idea. But you can use web workers yourself today. The APIs are very easy to work with, and there are
            polyfills.

            So if you have any JavaScript on your frontend that can run in a worker, please consider throwing it in a worker! Your
            framerate will improve, and your users will thank you. Thanks!
